# GPG Configuration
# For production, you need to provide your own GPG key ID and private key
# The Docker container automatically generates ephemeral keys for local testing

# GPG Key ID (the last 16 characters of your GPG key fingerprint)
# Example: GPG_KEY_ID=1234567890ABCDEF
GPG_KEY_ID=

# GPG Private Key (base64 encoded)
# To get your private key: gpg --armor --export-secret-keys YOUR_KEY_ID | base64 -w 0
# Example: GPG_PRIVATE_KEY=LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...
GPG_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Log Level for debugging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Production Notes:
# 1. Never commit real GPG keys to version control
# 2. Use secure key management in production (e.g., Docker secrets, HashiCorp Vault)
# 3. The Dockerfile generates ephemeral keys automatically for local testing
# 4. For production, generate a proper GPG key with: gpg --full-generate-key
